# Association of clonal haematopoiesis with telomere lengths in the UK Biobank​​

This is the repository accompanying the manuscript "Telomere attrition becomes an instrument for clonal selection in aging hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis" by McLoughlin, Cheloor Kovilakam & Dunn et al (Nature Genetics).

It houses the Python script used for the primary analyses investigating the relationship between clonal hematopoiesis (CH) and telomere length within the UK Biobank.  The script integrates multiple UK Biobank datasets, including baseline characteristics, telomere length measurements, somatic variant calls in CH-related genes, and phenotypic data.  It then performs linear and logistic regression analyses to explore the association between CH and telomere length.

Additional scripts for Mendelian Randomization (MR), targeted sequencing data analysis, and polygenic risk score (PRS) calculation are provided in separate folders, each named according to the specific analysis it supports.
